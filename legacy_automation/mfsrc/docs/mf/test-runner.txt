Plan
====


Test Dispatcher
---------------

#. Test discovery happens at server side.
#. Discovered tests are updated in mongo collection with status queued for the corresponding run id.
#. Test dispatcher must dispatch the tests to corresponding nodes.


Test Runner
-----------

#. Test runner must be able to re-discover the tests in same fashion as test dispatcher.
#. Must update relevant sates in mongo collection - started, aborted, pass, fail etc.,
#. Must update time taken to run the test
#. Must update log or standard stream where applicable


Test discovery
--------------

#. Inclusions and Exclusions based on regex patters in files within products

Run Time settings
-----------------
#. Use runtime instead of config or envcon as in web systems
